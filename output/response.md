Subject: Re: Your RFP Questions

Hello,

Thanks for the detailed questions. Please find our consolidated responses below.

1) What are the transaction processing capability (TPS), transaction time, and transaction fees (gas fees) of your chain?
   • Median fee < $0.001 and block confirmation ≈ 1 second thanks to PoH and Turbine propagation.

2) Do you have explorers and any recent audit coverage we can review?
   • Yes, public devnet and testnet are available with faucets and institutional token access.

If helpful, we can share links to public documentation and audits, or schedule a technical walk-through.

Best regards,
Solana Ecosystem Team
