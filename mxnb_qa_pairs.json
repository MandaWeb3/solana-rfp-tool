    "question": "Please provide a list of key partnership you have in the stablecoin sector",
    "answer": "The Solana network is open and permissionless and as a result there is no requirement for a stablecoin issuer to formally partner or engage in a commercial agreement with the Solana Foundation. However, as its role as ecosystem evangelists and catalysts, the Foundation works actively with issuers to support them with technical advisory, ecosystem activation, awareness and business advisory in a more informal basis. There are several notable examples of stablecoin issuers working with Solana Foundation and / or key ecosystem teams: \n\n- PayPal issuance of PYUSD on Solana, leveraging token-extensions to enable a rich set of compliance oriented features. PYUSD grew to $670 MM in supply in 3 months\n- Circle / USDC on Solana - 2.4 B in supply\n- Paxos issuance of USDP on Solana - the first chain after Eth L1 to be approved by NY DFS\n- USDT is issued in Solana ($0.7 B supply)\n- EURC just launched on Solana from Circle"

    "question": "If not, please explain how nonce management is handled",
    "answer": "Nonce management is handled in two different ways depending on the speed of transaction signing and submission:\nFor transactions that are created and broadcasted within 1 minute:\nA recent blockhash is signed as part of the transaction which ensures the transaction is recent and fairly unique. This also enables fast parallel processing of transactions as the network does not require a sequential nonce per account like in Ethereum.\n\nFor transactions that require more than 1 minute:\nDurable nonces are used to ensure uniquness. A durable nonce account is used to receive a nonce that can be used exactly once. After usage, the durable nonce account creates a new nonce for the next usage. To process multiple transactions that require more than 1 minute for processing from the same account, multiple durable nonce accounts should be used. For more information, read through this guide."

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the confirmation time for a block?",
    "answer": "~1s"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you introduce new blocks to the network?",
    "answer": "New blocks are introduced to the Solana network through a unique and efficient process that leverages several key innovations. Here's an overview of how block propagation works on Solana:\n1. Leader Selection\nSolana uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism combined with Proof-of-History (PoH) to select block producers, called leaders. Leaders are responsible for creating and introducing new blocks to the network.\n2. Continuous Block Production\nUnlike many other blockchains, Solana operates with continuous block production:\n- Validators are selected as leaders for 4 consecutive slots\n- Each slot represents a fixed time interval (~400ms)\n- This allows for rapid block creation and propagation\n3. Turbine Block Propagation\nSolana employs a protocol called Turbine to efficiently distribute new blocks across the network:\n- The leader \"shreds\" the block data into smaller pieces\n- These shreds are then propagated to other validators in a structured manner\n- Validators reassemble the shreds to reconstruct the full block\n- This process ensures swift and efficient distribution of block data across Solana, maintaining high throughput.\n4. Gulf Stream\n- Solana's Gulf Stream protocol eliminates the need for a mempool by allowing validators to begin processing upcoming transactions before they're even included in a block. This further enhances the speed of block propagation and transaction processing.\n5. Validator Confirmation\nOnce a validator receives and reconstructs a block:\n- It checks the block's validity\n- The validator then checks for transaction confirmations within the same slot\n\nFor more information read this guide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the incentive for users to keep the network secure?",
    "answer": "The Solana network uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which incentivizes users to stake their SOL tokens and delegate to validators or become validators. Staking helps secure the network by aligning economic interests with network security. Validators receive rewards from transaction fees and protocol-based inflation rewards for creating and validating (through voting) blocks."
  },
  {
    "question": "What level of security does your Blockchain/L2 offer vs other similar protocols?",
    "answer": "Solana provides a robust security model that is comparable to other blockchain protocols and often much better when compared to high throughput protocols.\n\nConsensus Mechanism:\nSolana uses a unique hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Proof-of-History (PoH):\n- The PoS component provides economic security through staking\n- PoH acts as a cryptographic clock, enhancing efficiency and security of the consensus process\n- This hybrid approach offers strong security while enabling high throughput and low latency.\nValidator Network:\nSolana's security relies on its decentralized network of validators:\n- As of 2024, there are about 4,500 validators securing the network (~1500 voting, ~3000 non-voting)\n- While this is fewer than some other major networks like Ethereum, it still provides a good level of decentralization\n- Validators are geographically distributed around the world and active stake is not reliant on any single hosting provider (largest hosting provider only supports 17% of active stake ensuring any major outage would not impact the broader network)\nSmart Contract Security:\n- The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) provides several security features for smart contracts:\n- Memory safety through Rust's ownership model\n- Deterministic execution environment\n- Limited attack surface due to Solana's account model (reentrancy attacks are limited as well)"
