        {
            "question": "What's the incentive for users to keep the network secure?",
            "answer": "The Solana network uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which incentivizes users to stake SOL tokens to participate in consensus and earn rewards. Validators are economically incentivized to maintain network security and integrity."

            "answer": "No. The Solana Foundation is a private foundation organized under the laws of Switzerland. As such, it does not require specific financial services licenses as it does not directly handle user funds or provide financial services."

        {
            "question": "Are your blockchain services offered to entities whose activities are regulated or for which registration, authorization, or licensing is required? If yes, do you have policies and procedures in place to verify that your clients have the applicable registration, authorization, or license?",
            "answer": "The Solana Foundation is not a for-profit entity and does not provide any 'blockchain services' as a business. The Foundation focuses on ecosystem development, education, and technical support for the Solana protocol."
